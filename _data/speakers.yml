  title: "RNA Velocity from dynamical exploration to inference"
  abstract: "RNA velocity is a computational approach that estimates the temporal component of gene expression from snapshot single-cell RNA sequencing data. By considering intronic and exonic mappings and modeling RNA metabolism, it approximates the future state of individual cells, becoming a key tool for studying embryogenesis. In this talk, I will trace the evolution of RNA velocity methods and highlight their advancements over the years. I will emphasize the transition from simple gene-wise models to joint, Bayesian, and generative models, discussing both the improvements and remaining limitations. Lastly, I will present our lab's latest work on VeloCycleVI, a tailored RNA velocity framework designed to study cell cycle-driven gene expression changes and their speed. The robustness and inference capabilities of this model showcase the potential for manifold-consistent modeling approaches in this rapidly evolving field."
  bio: "Prof. La Manno is a computational and developmental biologist heading the Neurodevelopmental Systems Biology Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). He has made significant early contributions in the field single-cell RNA sequencing, particularly in mapping the heterogeneity of the developing mammalian nervous system. Prof. La Manno is renowned for inventing the RNA Velocity analysis framework and developing spatial transcriptomics tomographical methods. His lab has also been at the forefront of research into lipid heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Throughout his career, he has earned numerous recognitions, such as the appointment to ELISIR Scholar, the EMPIRIS Award, the SIB Innovation Award, and the Dimitris N. Chorafas Prize."
