#### RECOMB-PRIEQ 2024 Call for Papers 
---

**The 14th RECOMB Satellite Conference on Biological Data Privacy and Equity (RECOMB-PRIEQ 2024)** will be held on the **28th of April, 2024** in Boston, MA just before the main RECOMB conference. The conference brings together leading researchers in genomics, privacy, security, and ethics to discuss emerging computational methodologies to overcome privacy, security, bias, and fairness issues in biomedical research.

---
#### Topics
---
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to
* **Re-identification of Individuals:** Exploring the use of high-throughput molecular phenotype datasets or clinical data for re-identifying individuals and the associated privacy risks.
* **Future Trends and Mitigation Strategies:** Identifying emerging trends in biomedical data privacy and discussing potential technological strategies such as cryptographic or statistical solutions to mitigate privacy risks.
* **Genomic Data Privacy:** Understanding the impact of DNA sequencing advancements and the increased availability of genomic data with novel statistical methods.
* **Balancing Privacy and Data Sharing:** Examining the challenges of striking a balance between safeguarding individuals’ privacy and facilitating scientific research and advancements with novel computational models grounded in privacy and utility.
* **Fairness and Equity:** Exploring methodologies that identify bias and promote fairness and equity in biomedical AI.

#### Tracks
---

We solicit contributions in three categories (“tracks”) as follows.

##### Proceedings Track

Manuscripts describing original work on computational aspects of genomic research involving large genomic datasets. Manuscripts in this track will be considered for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology. At the time of submission, and for the entire review period, the work should not be under review by any other conference or scientific journal. In some rare cases, manuscripts may be deemed to not be suitable for the Journal of Computational Biology after review but still invited for an oral presentation at RECOMB-PRI. In this case, authors will be required to post their manuscript on a public preprint server (bioRxiv, arXiv, PeerJ, etc.) prior to the conference.

To indicate your submission should be considered for the proceedings track, please include “[Proceedings]” at the end of the paper title.

##### Overlay Track

Manuscripts submitted to this track will be reviewed by the program committee, and selected submissions will be invited for oral presentation. The manuscript should be hosted on a public preprint server (bioRxiv, arXiv, etc.) at the time of submission. There are no specific formatting requirements, but the paper should generally be formatted in a way that emphasizes the methodological contributions. We also encourage authors to keep the manuscripts within similar length limits as for the proceedings track. Manuscripts can be submitted elsewhere at the same time but should not be published or in press at the time of submission. For manuscripts that are in press or published, please consider the Highlights track of the main RECOMB conference.

To indicate your submission should be considered for the overlay track, please include “[Overlay]” at the end of the paper title.

##### Abstracts for highlights, short talks, or posters 

Regular abstracts describing original work, including software applications. These will be considered for short oral presentations or posters. A 1-2 page abstract describing the methods and key results should be submitted via the EasyChair system. Abstracts submitted can be from work that is already published or in progress. 

---
#### Paper and Abstract Submission Procedures
---
Manuscripts for the “proceedings track” should not exceed 10 pages using at least 10 point font on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper with no less than one inch margin all around. This excludes the cover page and references. The cover page should have the title and the corresponding author’s email address. An optional short appendix can be included if necessary but reading it will be at the discretion of the program committee. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the EasyChair system.

In EasyChair, please select “RECOMBPrivacy 2024” track within RECOMB conference at <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2024>

An author of each accepted paper and abstract is expected to attend the workshop and present the work.

##### Special handling of papers submitted to RECOMB 2024
---

 If you would like to submit a paper rejected by RECOMB 2024 to RECOMB-PRI, you have the option to transfer your reviews. In that case, kindly submit a single PDF by the regular deadline of January 31, 2024. Ensure that the submission begins with the reviews received from RECOMB, followed by a rebuttal addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers. The submitted manuscript should also be modified according to the reviews, or provide an explanation of why modifications are unnecessary. All reviews will be treated confidentially and will only be visible to the PC members. Note that authors of papers rejected by RECOMB 2024 may also submit their paper without transferring their reviews, if they wish to do so.
